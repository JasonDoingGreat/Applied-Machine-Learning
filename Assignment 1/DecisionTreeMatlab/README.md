Assignment 1 --- Decision Tree
==============================

### Running Code

In order to run the code in the file, there are several lines (maybe) need to be changed:

*1. line 5: Change the directory to the one where you put this file in your computer, otherwise it will show the error that it cannot find the functions.

2. line 30: If you want to change the prune level, you may change it here, the default value is 10. Maximum value is 11.

3. line 56: If you add more decision trees and would like to see their accuracy, add them into the DTTreeSet here. function 'makeprediction' will automatically get the size of DTTreeSet.

4. You can uncomment part of the code, they are the debugging part to determine the leaf size and prune level using the error method.
